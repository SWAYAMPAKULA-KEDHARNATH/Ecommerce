#Ecommerce:

I developed a React-based e-commerce website featuring essential functionalities for online shopping. The website includes a navigation bar with search capabilities, a product display section with category filtering, detailed product pages, and a cart management system for adding, updating quantities, and removing items. I utilized React Router for efficient page navigation and created components for seamless user interactions. This project showcases my ability to build user-friendly web applications with core e-commerce features.
